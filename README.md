# Photovoltaics - EMMO domain ontology

This ontology is describing Perovskite solar cells.

## Workflow

Each ontology entry is an issue with the tag *ontology entry*. All discussions regarding the entries can be done inside the issue.

## Inspect the ontology directly (locally) - *Try before buying*

One can inspect the ontology locally without downloading this repository in any way.

To do this, ensure that you have Protégé (or a similar ontology explorer) and have it set up in a proper way to inspect EMMO ontologies.
Then, open the special Turtle file at this location: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emmo-repo/domain-photovoltaics/development/domain_photovoltaics_github.ttl`

The exact steps needed to do this in Protégé are the following:

1. Open Protégé.
1. Go to "File -> Open from URL...".
1. In the "URI" text box, enter the URL written above (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emmo-repo/domain-photovoltaics/development/domain_photovoltaics_github.ttl`).
1. Press "OK".
